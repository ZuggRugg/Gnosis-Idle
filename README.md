# Description
This is a project where I am building a compiler/interpreter from scratch for an idle game 
It will also use raylib as the graphics library for the game itself

## Gameplay
You will get randomized choices on how to improve your equation, but might also have to choose which equations
would be the least detrimental for you


## Implementation 
This Project is requires C++11 or greater.
