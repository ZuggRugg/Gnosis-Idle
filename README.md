# Description
This is a project where I am building a compiler/interpreter from scratch for an idle game 
It will also use raylib as the graphics library for the game itself

## Gameplay
You will get randomized choices on how to improve your equation for the game, but might also have to choose which equations
would be the least detrimental for you in the long run.

## Implementation 
This Project requires C++11 or greater.
